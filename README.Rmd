iNEXT.beta3D (iNterpolation and EXTrapolation for three dimensions of Beta diversity) is an original R package available in [Github](https://github.com/AnneChao). 
An online version of [iNEXT.beta3D Online](https://chao.shinyapps.io/iNEXT_beta3D/) is also available for users without an R background. Detailed information about all functions in iNEXT.beta3D is provided in the iNEXT.beta3D Manual in [iNEXT.beta3D_vignettes](http://chao.stat.nthu.edu.tw/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/software/A%20Quick%20Introduction%20to%20iNEXT.beta3D.html), which is available from [Anne Chao's website](http://chao.stat.nthu.edu.tw/wordpress/software_download/).

`iNEXT.beta3D` focuses on Chiu's et al.'s multiple assemblages decomposition (Chiu, Jost, and Chao (2014)) based on three measures of Hill numbers of order q: species richness (`q = 0`), Shannon diversity (`q = 1`, the exponential of Shannon entropy) and Simpson diversity 
(`q = 2`, the inverse of Simpson concentration). Besides, `iNEXT.beta3D` also promote phylogenetic diversity level and functional diversity level. For each diversity measure, `iNEXT.beta3D` uses the observed sample of abundance or incidence data (called the "reference sample") 
to compute diversity estimates and the associated 95% confidence intervals for the following two types of rarefaction and extrapolation (R/E): 

1. Sample-size-based (or size-based) R/E sampling curves: `iNEXT.beta3D` computes gamma, alpha, and beta diversity estimates for rarefied and extrapolated samples up to an appropriate size. This type of sampling curve plots the diversity estimates with respect to sample size.     
2. Coverage-based R/E sampling curves: `iNEXT.beta3D` computes gamma, alpha, and beta diversity estimates for rarefied and extrapolated samples based on a standardized level of sample completeness (as measured by sample coverage) up to an appropriate coverage value. This type of sampling curve plots the diversity estimates with respect to sample coverage. 

`iNEXT.beta3D` plots the above two types of sampling curves for gamma, alpha, and beta diversity and four dissimilarity-turnover.


### SOFTWARE NEEDED TO RUN iNEXT.beta3D IN R

-   Required: [R](http://cran.rstudio.com/)
-   Suggested: [RStudio IDE](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/)

### HOW TO RUN iNEXT.beta3D:

The `iNEXT.beta3D` package can be downloaded from Anne Chao's [iNEXT.beta3D_github](https://github.com/AnneChao/iNEXT.beta3D) using the following commands. For a first-time installation, additional visualization extension packages (`ggplot2`) from CRAN and (`iNEXT.3D`) from Anne Chao's github must be installed and loaded. 

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
# install_github('AnneChao/iNEXT.3D')
# library(iNEXT.3D)

## install the latest version from github
install.packages('devtools')
library(devtools)

install_github('AnneChao/iNEXT.beta3D')
## import packages
library(iNEXT.beta3D)

library(ggplot2)
```


Here are two main functions we provide in this package : 

- **iNEXTbeta3D** : Computing standardized gamma, alpha, beta diversity, and four dissimilarity-turnover indices for three dimensions: taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity at specified sample coverage or sample size.

- **ggiNEXTbeta3D** : Visualizing the output from the function `iNEXTbeta3D`


## MAIN FUNCTION: iNEXTbeta3D()

We first describe the main function `iNEXTbeta3D()` with default arguments: 

<br>
iNEXTbeta3D(data, diversity = "TD", q = c(0, 1, 2), datatype = "abundance",
            base = "coverage", level = NULL, nboot = 20, conf = 0.95,
            PDtree = NULL, PDreftime = NULL, PDtype = "meanPD",
            FDdistM = NULL, FDtype = "AUC", FDtau = NULL, FDcut_number = 30)
<br>

The arguments of this function are briefly described below, and will be explained in more details by illustrative examples in later text. This main function computes gamma, alpha and beta diversity estimates of order q at specified sample coverage or sample size and measure of diversity. By default of <code>base = "size"</code> and <code>level = NULL</code>, then this function computes the gamma and alpha diversity estimates up to double the reference sample size in each region. If <code>base = "coverage"</code> and <code>level = NULL</code>, then this function computes the gamma, alpha, beta diversity, and four dissimilarity-turnover indices estimates up to one (for q = 1, 2) or up to the coverage of double the reference sample size (for q = 0).

This function returns an `"iNEXTbeta3D"` object which can be further used to make plots 
using the function `ggiNEXTbeta3D()` to be described below. 


## DATA FORMAT/INFORMATION
Two types of data are supported:

1. Individual-based abundance data (`datatype = "abundance"`):
Input data for each region with several assemblages/sites include samples species abundances in an empirical sample of n individuals (â€œreference sample"). When there are N assemblages in a region, input data consist of a list with an S by N abundance matrix; For M regions consisting N assemblages, input data should be M lists of S by N abundance matrix.

2. Sampling-unit-based incidence data (`datatype = "incidence_raw"`):
Input data for a reference sample consist of a species-by-sampling-unit matrix;
The number of sampling units and species for each assemblages in a region should be the same.
For M regions consisting N assemblages, input data should be M lists of N lists of species-by-sampling-unit matrix.


Two data sets ( Beetles under different time periods for abundance and incidence raw data ) are included in `iNEXT.beta3D` package for illustration. For abundance data, the beetles data consist a list of two matrices ("unlogged" and "logged"). Each matrix represents a species-by-time (year 2008 and 2009) in a regions. For incidence raw data, the beetles data consist two lists ("unlogged" and "logged"). For each list, it has two matrices (each means year 2008 and 2009) which represents a species-by-sampling units assemblage. For these data, the following commands display how to compute taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional beta decomposition and dissimilarities at specified sample coverage for abundance and incidence raw data respectively.

Run the following code to view Beetles abundance data: (Here we only show the first ten rows for each matrix)

```{r eval=FALSE}
data("beetle_abu")
beetle_abu
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
data("beetle_abu")
lapply(beetle_abu, function(x) x[1:10,])
```

Run the following code to view Beetles incidence raw data: (Here we only show the first ten rows and six columns for each matrix)

```{r eval=FALSE}
data("beetle_inc")
beetle_abu
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
data("beetle_inc")
lapply(beetle_inc, function(x) lapply(x, function(y) y[1:10,1:6]))
```


When `base = 'coverage'`, the `iNEXTbeta3D()` function returns the `"iNEXTbeta3D"` object including seven data frames for each regions: 

- gamma 
- alpha 
- beta
- C ( Sorensen-type non-overlap )
- U ( Jaccard-type  non-overlap )
- V ( Sorensen-type turnover )
- S ( Jaccard-type  turnover )

When `base = 'size'`, the `iNEXTbeta3D()` function returns the `"iNEXTbeta3D"` object including two data frames for each regions: 

- gamma 
- alpha 


## Rarefaction/Extrapolation Via Examples

## Taxonomic Diversity ##

First, we run the `iNEXTbeta3D()` function with beetles abundance data to compute standardized gamma, alpha, beta diversity, and four dissimilarities under `base = 'coverage'`. (Here we only show the first six outputs for each output in region "unlogged")

```{r eval=FALSE}
data("beetle_abu")

# Taxonomic diversity
Abundance_TD = iNEXTbeta3D(data = beetle_abu, diversity = 'TD', datatype = "abundance", 
                           base = 'coverage', nboot = 30)
Abundance_TD
```


```{r echo=FALSE}
Abundance_TD = iNEXTbeta3D(data = beetle_abu, diversity = 'TD', datatype = "abundance", 
                           base = 'coverage', nboot = 30)
lapply(Abundance_TD$`2008 vs. 2009 unlogged`, function(x) {
    tmp = x[1:6,]
    tmp[,c('Estimate', 'Size', 's.e.', 'LCL', 'UCL')] = round(tmp[,c('Estimate', 'Size', 's.e.', 'LCL', 'UCL')], 3)
    tmp
})
```

The output contains seven data frames: `gamma`, `alpha`, `beta`, `C`, `U`, `V`, `S`. For each data frame, it includes the diversity estimate (`Estimate`), the diversity order (`Order.q`), `Method` (Interpolated, Observed, or Extrapolated, depending on whether the size `m` is less than, equal to, or greater than the reference sample size), the sample coverage estimate (`SC`), the sample size (`Size`), the standard error from bootstrap replications (`s.e.`), the 95% lower and upper confidence limits of diversity (`LCL`, `UCL`), and the name of region (`Region`). These
diversity estimates with confidence intervals are used for plotting the diversity curve.


Then, we can also use beetles incidence raw data to compute standardized gamma, alpha, beta diversity, and four dissimilarities under `base = 'coverage'`. (Here we don't show the output)

```{r eval=FALSE}
data("beetle_inc")

Incidence_TD = iNEXTbeta3D(data = beetle_inc, diversity = 'TD', datatype = "incidence_raw",
                           base = 'coverage', nboot = 30)
Incidence_TD
```


## Phylogenetic Diversity ##

We can compute standardized gamma, alpha, beta diversity under phylogenetic level with newick format data (`beetle_tree`). Here, `PDtree` is the essential setting, and user can select `PDtype` and `PDreft` alternatively. `PDtype` has two selection: `"PD"` (effective total branch length) or `"meanPD"` (effective number of equally divergent lineages). `PDreft` means a numerical value specifying reference time for computing phylogenetic diversity. If `PDreft = NULL`, then it is set the reference time to the age of the root of PDtree. (Here we don't show the output)

```{r eval=FALSE}
data("beetle_abu")
data("beetle_inc")
data("beetle_tree")


# Phylogenetic diversity
Abundance_PD = iNEXTbeta3D(data = beetle_abu, diversity = 'PD', datatype = "abundance", 
                           base = 'coverage', nboot = 30, PDtree = beetle_tree)
Abundance_PD

Incidence_PD = iNEXTbeta3D(data = beetle_inc, diversity = 'PD', datatype = "incidence_raw", 
                           base = 'coverage', nboot = 30, PDtree = beetle_tree)
Incidence_PD
```


## Functional Diversity ##
We can compute standardized gamma, alpha, beta diversity under functional level with distance matrix (`beetle_distM`). Here, `FDdistM` is the essential setting, and user can select `FDtype`, `FDtau`, and `FDcut_number` alternatively. `FDtype` hase two selections: "tau_value" means compute functional diversity under a specific threshold value and "AUC" means compute functional diversity by integrating all threshold values between zero and one. If user selects `FDtype = "tau_value"`, it need to input a `FD_tau` threshold value. If `FD_tau = NULL`, then it is set to be the mean distance between any two individuals randomly selected from the pooled assemblage (i.e., quadratic entropy). (Here we don't show the output)

```{r eval=FALSE}
data("beetle_abu")
data("beetle_inc")
data("beetle_distM")


# Functional diversity - under specified threshold
Abundance_FDtau = iNEXTbeta3D(data = beetle_abu, diversity = 'FD', datatype = "abundance", 
                              base = 'coverage', nboot = 30, 
                              FDdistM = beetle_distM, FDtype = 'tau_value')
Abundance_FDtau

Incidence_FDtau = iNEXTbeta3D(data = beetle_inc, diversity = 'FD', datatype = "incidence_raw", 
                              base = 'coverage', nboot = 30, 
                              FDdistM = beetle_distM, FDtype = 'tau_value')
Incidence_FDtau


# Functional diversity - area under curve (integrates all threshold values between zero and one)
Abundance_FDAUC = iNEXTbeta3D(data = beetle_abu, diversity = 'FD', datatype = "abundance", 
                              base = 'coverage', nboot = 30, 
                              FDdistM = beetle_distM, FDtype = 'AUC')
Abundance_FDAUC

Incidence_FDAUC = iNEXTbeta3D(data = beetle_inc, diversity = 'FD', datatype = "incidence_raw", 
                              base = 'coverage', nboot = 30, 
                              FDdistM = beetle_distM, FDtype = 'AUC')
Incidence_FDAUC
```


### GRAPHIC DISPLAYS: FUNCTION ggiNEXTbeta3D()

The function `ggiNEXTbeta3D()`, which extends `ggplot2` to the `"iNEXTbeta3D"` object with default arguments, is described as follows: 

<br>
ggiNEXTbeta3D(output, type = "B", scale = "free")  
<br>


```{r, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
Des <- c("output","",
"type","(required only when base = 'coverage'), selection of plot type : type = 'B' for plotting the gamma, alpha, and beta diversity ; type = 'D' for plotting 4 turnover dissimilarities.",
"scale","Are scales shared across all facets (the default, 'fixed'), or do they vary across rows ('free_x'), columns ('free_y'), or both rows and columns ('free')? Default is 'free'.",
"transp","a value between 0 and 1 controlling transparency. 'transp = 0' is completely transparent, default is '0.4'.")
output <- 
  matrix(Des, 
         ncol=2, byrow = TRUE)

library(htmlTable)
htmlTable(output,
          header =  c("Argument","Description"),align = "l"
          )
```

The `ggiNEXTbeta3D()` function is a wrapper around the `ggplot2` package to create a R/E curve using a single line of code. The resulting object is of class `"ggplot"`, so it can be manipulated using the `ggplot2` tools. Users can visualize the output of beta diversity or four dissimilarities by setting the parameter 'type':

```{r}
Abundance_TD = iNEXTbeta3D(data = beetle_abu, diversity = 'TD', datatype = "abundance", 
                           base = 'coverage', nboot = 30)
ggiNEXTbeta3D(Abundance_TD, type = 'B')
```


```{r}
ggiNEXTbeta3D(Abundance_TD, type = 'D')
```


The following commands return the size-based R/E sampling curves for gamma and alpha taxonomic diversity:

```{r}
output = iNEXTbeta3D(data = beetle_abu, diversity = 'TD', datatype = "abundance", 
                     base = "size", nboot = 30)
ggiNEXTbeta3D(output)
```
